"""
In Python, a data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Python is a
dynamically typed language, which means that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of variable; the
interpreter infers it based on the value assigned to the variable. However, Python does have built-in data types,
and you can use them to specify the type of data a variable should hold.

One extra thing, type() helps to show the datatype of that specific datatype.
"""
#  int: Integer type, represents whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3, 0).

x = 5
print(x)
print(type(x))

# float: Floating-point type, represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
y = 3.14
print(y)
print(type(y))

""" To declare string datatype, we have to give '' or "" 
str: String type, represents sequences of characters (e.g., "hello", 'Python'). """
z = "Hello, Python!"
print(z)
print(type(z))

# bool: Boolean type, represents truth values (True or False).
a = True
print(a)
print(type(a))

"""
We have some more datatypes like list, set, tuple but we will discuss separately later in our upcoming videos
